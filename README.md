##Description:
Triangle tracker is a learning tool, with the abillity to differentiate the types of a triangle when the user keys in the values of the three sides of the triangle. (Equilateral, isosceles,scalene, or even when not a triangle.)

##Technologies Used:
*  HTML
*  CSS
*  Javascript
*  Markdown

##BDD:
This tool is expected to work as listed below:
*  Display a submit and a refresh function.
*  Be able to display an input button for the user.
*  If the values entered by the user are all equal - The result should be "Equilateral triangle: All sides are equal".
*  If the user enters two equal sides - The result should be "Isosceles triangle: Two sides are equal"
*  If the user enter values that aren't equal - The result should be "Scalene: No sides are equal"
*  If the values entered by the user are quite unrealistic to make a triangle, the the result will be "Not a triangle"

##Setup Requirements:
*  Internet connection
*  Web browser
